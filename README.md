# My first project

---

Project resides here: https://romchyfcc.github.io/Project01/

From a course inspired theme I made a full blown project out of it.
All code written is my own, I've used the course exercise merely for inspiration.

Planned functionality:

1. ~~store session locally~~
3. create buttons for views
4. Add prefixes
5. ~~Cross off li elements when done --> this will take extra work because i need to implement a span in the li elements which means i need to rework a lot of things for it to properly work~~
6. ~~clear local storage button~~
7. ~~tooltip~~
8. ~~animated todos~~
